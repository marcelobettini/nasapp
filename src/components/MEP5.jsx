      <h4>RESEARCH PROGRAMS</h4>
      <p>
        Scientific research to increase our knowledge of Mars as a planetary
        system is a key activity that NASA funds. The primary mechanism for
        providing this funding is what is known as Research and Analysis (R&A)
        programs. Scientists from all over the United States (university
        professors, NASA center researchers, etc.) submit research grant
        proposals to these programs. The proposals are peer reviewed and
        selected for funding based on the quality of science.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dedicated Mars research program is the Mars Data Analysis Program
        (MDAP). The goal of MDAP is to enhance the scientific return of data
        collected during Mars missions. Data used in the program must be
        publicly available 30 days before the proposal submission deadline.
        Currently there are 108 active grants and 10 active NASA Earth and Space
        Science Fellowships (NESSF) for graduate students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mars research is also well represented in other R&A programs in the
        Planetary Science Division (primarily in the Solar System Workings and
        Habitable Worlds Programs).
      </p>
      <p>
        Results of research activities are published in peer reviewed
        publications and presented at scientific conferences.
