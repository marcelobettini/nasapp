      <h4>TECHNOLOGIES</h4>
      <p>
        The Mars Exploration Program invests in its own Mars-relevant
        technologies, as well as staying abreast of complementary innovations
        across NASA and the Aerospace industry. Technology investments unique to
        Mars include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Mars Ascent Vehicle:</b> An essential element if NASA is ever to
          return materials (or people) from Mars, NASA’s Mars Exploration
          Program is currently investing in propulsion & guidance technology
          that could survive the trip to Mars and its harsh surface environments
          before being launched back into space. Hybrid rocket motors using
          paraffin fuel burned with liquid oxides of nitrogen are especially
          promising for this application. Within the thin Mars atmosphere,
          aerodynamic controls such as fins will not be effective, so
          investments are also being made in Liquid Injection Thrust Vector
          Control (LITVC). Using small ports to inject liquid oxidizer directly
          into the nozzle at different points, the direction of the MAV can be
          controlled quickly and effectively with no moving parts, even in the
          thin atmosphere on Mars.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Planetary Protection Technologies:</b> NASA’s Mars Exploration
          Program is also investing in technologies to enable the safe transport
          of materials from Mars to Earth (e.g., technologies for containing
          samples and sample containers for Mars materials, as well as
          technologies for sterilizing the outsides of these containers).
          Although it is not known whether or not life ever existed on Mars,
          concept studies for returning Martian material are conducted under
          safety standards that are as high as, or higher than, standards used
          for transporting known hazardous material on Earth. Technologies
          currently under investigation include in-space sterilization
          approaches (e.g., localized heat sterilization and plasma
          sterilization), as well as sealing technologies (e.g., in-space metal
          brazing and explosive welding).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>From Robots to Humans</h4>
      <p>
        The science and technology developed through the Mars Exploration
        Program will enable humans to one day explore the Red Planet.
