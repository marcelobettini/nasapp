      <h4>ABOUT THE PROGRAM </h4>
      <p>
        NASA’s Mars Exploration Program is a science-driven,technology-enabled
        study of Mars as a planetary system in order to understand:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the formation and early evolution of Mars as a planet</li>
        <li>
          the history of geological and climate processes that have shaped Mars
          through time
        </li>
        <li>
          the potential for Mars to have hosted life (its “biological
          potential”)
        </li>
        <li>
          the future exploration of Mars by humans, and how Mars compares to and
          contrasts with Earth
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        MEP’s programmatic goals are directly responsive to the Agency’s 2014
        Strategic Plan. They include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>maintaining a continuous scientific presence at Mars</li>
        <li>
          providing continuing improvements in technical capabilities of robotic
          Mars missions
        </li>
        <li>
          capitalizing on measurement opportunities that contribute to the
          advancement of knowledge required for future human exploration of
          Mars, in collaboration with the Human Exploration and Operation
          Mission Directorate (HEOMD) and the Space Technology Mission
          Directorate (STMD)
        </li>
        <li>
          ensuring that scientific measurements that can enable human
          exploration of Mars are considered for flight, and that opportunities
          to fly instruments-of-opportunity and technology demonstrations from
          HEOMD and STMD are exercised on a mutually agreed upon basis
        </li>
        <li>
          supporting communications activities required for the successful
          conduct of MEP’s core science mission and NASA’s goals for helping to
          develop scientific literacy in the nation
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        MEP efforts also respond directly to NASA’s 2014 Science Plan. MEP
        derives its science goals from interactions with the planetary and Mars
        science community (e.g., through the Mars Exploration Program Analysis
        Group, or MEPAG). MEP has an evolving science strategy, with related MEP
        Science Goals that are consistent with the priorities in the 2011 Solar
        System Decadal Survey Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the
        Decade 2013-2022, conducted by the National Academy of Science’s
        National Research Council (NRC). These goals are formed into specific
        requirements and, as appropriate, applied to the individual missions in
        Program-level project requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        To support an integrated program structure, MEP carries out a number of
        activities that provide crosscutting functions and long-term investments
        for the future.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Mars Data and Analysis Program (MDAP) is a scientific research and
          analysis effort that sponsors detailed studies of data returned from
          Mars missions in order to shape the next steps of the Program’s
          future-mission studies. Research conducted through MDAP is intended to
          improve upon open science questions at Mars relevant to current
          hypotheses. Brief synopses of research funded through MDAP can be
          found on the NSPIRES website and typing in MDAP as the keyword.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Program Formulation Office conducts advanced studies of future
          missions. MEP sets priorities for these studies through informal
          (e.g., MEPAG) and formal channels (e.g., the National Academies’ Solar
          System Decadal Surveys). Studies and planning for these missions, as
          well as identification of technology needs and investments to meet
          them, are the focus of long-range program planning and targeted
          technology investments. Advanced studies also address possible needs
          to replenish Mars telecommunication capabilities and other
          programmatic support (e.g., landing site certification) that may be
          needed to support future missions. Orbiters with these required
          capabilities and/or other priorities such as sample return flight
          elements may also provide opportunities to address science objectives.
          Missions that address other Agency objectives (e.g., preparations for
          the future human exploration of the martian system) are considered
          jointly with key stakeholders from other parts of the Agency. An
          additional responsibility for the Program Formulation Office is
          definition of interfaces between ongoing missions or missions in
          development, and future missions that have not yet begun development.
          This activity is especially important where Program objectives require
          coordination across multiple projects (e.g., the case of multiple
          missions cooperating on the return of samples from the surface of
          Mars).

          The MEP supports the implementation of large and small directed
          missions as well as those that are competitively selected and led by a
          PI. These missions have included the Phoenix mission, which landed in
          the northern polar region of Mars to study ice, and the MAVEN mission,
          which is quantifying the rate of escape of atmospheric gases from the
          planet and implications for the ancient martian climate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Other crosscutting activities include overall science strategy
          optimization, Program risk management, Program risk communication,
          telecommunication strategy, advanced capability development
          (technology and program infrastructure), interfaces with future
          missions, planetary protection, and communications with target NASA
          audiences identified in the 2013 NASA Communications Framework.
