      <h4>WHY MARS?</h4>
      <p>
        There are several strategic, practical and scientific reasons for humans
        to explore Mars. Among them we know that Mars is the most accessible
        place in the solar system. Additionally, exploring Mars provides the
        opportunity to possibly answer origin and evolution of life questions,
        and could someday be a destination for survival of humankind.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the strategic sense, exploring Mars demonstrates our political and
        economic leadership as a nation, improves the quality of life on Earth,
        helps us learn about our home planet, and expands US leadership in the
        peaceful, international exploration of space.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a practical perspective we know that Mars is unique across the
        entire solar system in that it is a terrestrial planet with an
        atmosphere and climate, its geology is known to be very diverse and
        complex (like Earth), and it appears that the climate of Mars has
        changed over its history (like Earth).
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, many of the key questions in solar system science can be
        addressed effectively by exploring Mars. This endeavor also serves to
        inspire the next generation of explorers and dramatically expand human
        knowledge.
